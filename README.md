# Fullstack - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Duration: ~2 days

Engineering: 5/10

Analytics: 5/10

## Overview: 

Understanding a dataset is vital in machine learning, as it underpins model creation and training. It begins with identifying data sources, which could range from databases to APIs. Once collected, data is cleaned and preprocessed to address issues like missing values and outliers that can affect model performance. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) reveals patterns and relationships, helping us to understand potential biases or imbalances. Visualization techniques aid in understanding data's distribution and characteristics. These insights inform the choice of machine learning algorithms, feature engineering techniques, and evaluation metrics, leading to accurate and reliable models.

## Goal of this section week:
