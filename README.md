# Fullstack - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Duration: ~2 days

Engineering: 5/10

Analytics: 5/10

## Overview: 

Gathering and understanding a dataset is a crucial step in the machine learning process, as it forms the foundation upon which models are built and trained. The first step is to identify the relevant sources of data, which could include databases, APIs, web scraping, or manually collected information. Once the data is collected, it is essential to clean and preprocess it, addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies that could negatively impact the model's performance. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is then performed to gain insights into the dataset, uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships between features, as well as identifying potential biases or imbalances that may require further preprocessing. Visualization techniques, such as histograms, scatterplots, and heatmaps, can be employed during this stage to better understand the data's characteristics and distribution. Understanding the dataset ultimately leads to more informed decisions when selecting machine learning algorithms, feature engineering techniques, and evaluation metrics, which in turn contributes to the development of more accurate and reliable models.
