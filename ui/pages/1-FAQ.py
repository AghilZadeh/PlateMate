        The data on this website consists of a comprehensive collection of recipes and reviews. 
        These datasets were obtained by scraping information from [food.com](www.food.com) and cover the period from 1999 to 2020. 
        The recipes dataset encompasses approximately 500,000 recipes across 312 different categories. 
        It provides detailed information about each recipe, including cooking times, servings, ingredients, nutrition facts, instructions, and more.

    The reviews dataset, on the other hand, comprises around 1,400,000 reviews contributed by approximately 270,000 distinct users. 
    This dataset offers valuable insights into the authorship, ratings, review text, and additional information. 
    These reviews play a significant role in the development of our recommender system model.

with st.expander("What type of model is being used?"):
    st.write("""
        The recommender model on this website is based on a matrix factorization technique. 
        It utilizes the scikit-surprise library, a powerful tool for building recommendation systems. 
        By employing matrix factorization, the model can extract meaningful patterns and relationships from the dataset. 
        The recommender model is trained using our dataset, which includes a collection of recipes and reviews. 
        Additionally, the model takes into account the preferences expressed by the user. 
        By incorporating these preferences, the model can personalize recommendations based on individual tastes and interests.
