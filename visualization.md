# Visualization

## Overview

Visualizing training data before diving into modeling helps identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers that might impact the model's performance. One of the main benefits of visualizations is that they can serve as a sanity check for data, helping to identify outliers, null values, and other anomalies. It is important to carefully review visualizations to ensure that they accurately represent the underlying data. 

## How we do this:

There are many different ways to visualize data and you are free to use whichever method you prefer to identify patterns in the data. 

Here are some common ways to visualize data:

Histograms - Histograms are a great way to visualize the distribution and detect outliers in a dataset.

Scatterplots - Scatterplots are a great way to visualize the relationship between two variables.

Boxplots - Boxplots are a great way to visualize the distribution of a dataset and detect outliers.

## Assumptions/Considerations

- Multiple ways to plot something. Consider which representation is the most intuitive.
- We can measure the quality of a plot in the amount of time it takes a reader to understand. We want readers to look at a plot and immediately understand what they are looking at.
